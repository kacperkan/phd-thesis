\section{Potential Societal Impact} Our approach is a
  general framework for modeling Gaussian Splatting~\cite{kerbl20233d}, and,
  therefore, inherits its potential misuses.
  The abuse includes topics like fake identity
  generation~\cite{zhang2024e3gen}, using copy-righted content for own
  financial benefit, and detrimental effects of using GPU clusters for
  training on environment~\cite{bouza2023estimate}.
  We admit that negative impact.
  However, we posit, that each of them can be addressed by deep-fake detection
  methods~\cite{pei2024deepfake}, improving existing methods that achieve
  better results on open-source material, and by training lighter
  representations~\cite{lee2024compact,niedermayr2024compressed,fang2024mini}.

\section{Additional Results}
  We present additional, per-subject quantitative results
  in~\cref{tab:clog-supp-quantitative} and extended ablation studies over
  additional scales $\lod{\in}\{0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0\}$ (for
  reference,~\cref{tab:clog-ablation} involves
  $\lod{=}1.0$)~\cref{tab:clog-supp-ablation}.
  We also include more reconstruction samples and comparison to baselines
  in~\cref{fig:clog-supp-qualitative-rec} and the visualization the LoD
  progression has on the results in~\cref{fig:clog-supp-qualitative-lod}.
  % Please see the attached~\texttt{README.html} for animated LoD change and
  % novel view synthesis, and video in~\texttt{WATCHME.mp4} for narrated method
  % explanation.
