\section{Conclusions}

  We presented Continuous Levels of Gaussians (CLoG), a novel approach that
  enables continuous levels of detail for 3D Gaussian Splatting.
  Our method embeds Gaussians on a 2D UV map that can be dynamically
  downsampled to any resolution to provide levels of detail.
  To account for using fewer Gaussians, we introduce a modulator network that
  adapts Gaussian features to lower resolutions.
  We demonstrated that CLoG achieves comparable quality to existing methods at
  their highest resolution while providing the unique ability to smoothly
  transition between different levels of detail, with the best trade-off
  between quality and the number of Gaussians.
