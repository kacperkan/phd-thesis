\section{Conclusions}
  \label{sec:blendfields-conclusion}
  We present a general approach, \blendfields, for rendering high-frequency
  expression-dependent details using NeRFs.
  \blendfields draws inspiration from classical computer graphics by blending expressions from the training data to render expressions unseen during training.
  We show that \blendfields renders images in a controllable and interpretable
  manner for novel expressions and can be applied to render human avatars
  learned from publicly available datasets.
  We additionally discuss the potential misuse of our work in the
  \supplementary{}.
