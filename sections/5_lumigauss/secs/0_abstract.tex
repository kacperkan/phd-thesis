\section{Abstract}
  Decoupling lighting from geometry using unconstrained photo collections is
  notoriously challenging.
  Solving it would benefit many users as creating complex 3D assets takes days
  of manual labor.
  Many previous works have attempted to address this issue, often at the
  expense of output fidelity, which questions the practicality of such
  methods.
  We introduce \lumigauss---a technique that tackles 3D reconstruction of
  scenes and environmental lighting through 2D Gaussian Splatting.
  Our approach yields high-quality scene reconstructions and enables realistic
  lighting synthesis under novel environment maps.
  We also propose a method for enhancing the quality of shadows, common in
  outdoor scenes, by exploiting spherical harmonics properties.
  Our approach facilitates seamless integration with game engines and enables
  the use of fast precomputed radiance transfer.
  We validate our method on the NeRF-OSR dataset, demonstrating superior
  performance over baseline methods.
  Moreover, \lumigauss can synthesize realistic images for unseen environment
  maps.
