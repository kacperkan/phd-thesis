\section{Conclusions}
  \label{sec:lumigauss-conclusions}

  We present \lumigauss---the method capable of decoupling environment
  lighting and albedo of objects from images \textit{in-the-wild}.
  To this end, we apply 2DGS~\cite{huang20242d} to reconstruct the object's
  surface accurately and then use our proposed training components that
  correctly disentangle light properties from the rendered colors.
  As we show in the experiments, our approach achieves better reconstruction
  results than the baselines.
  We also present that one of our contributions---modeling shadows via
  leveraging Spherical Harmonics properties---provides shadows of high
  fidelity that react appropriately to changing environment light.
  \lumigauss is a novel approach in the direction of inverting the rendering process from images \textit{in-the-wild}, reconstructing high-quality scene properties without sacrificing the fidelity of the output.
