  \caption{{\bf Effect of annotation quality -- }
    Our method is moderately robust to the quality of annotations.
    We visualize the results for two expressions: frowning and smiling, while
    keeping both eyes in a neutral position.
    Even with wildly varying annotations as shown, the reconstructions are
    reasonably controlled, with the exception of the top row, where we show a
    case where the annotations is too restrictive, resulting in the annotation
    being ignored for one eye.
    We show in bottom row also an interesting case, where the mask is large
    enough to start capturing the correlation among mouth expressions and the
    eye.
