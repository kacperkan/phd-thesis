  \caption{{\bf Novel view and novel attribute synthesis on synthetic data -- }
    We show examples of novel view and novel attribute synthesis on synthetic
    data.
    The scene is composed of three objects, where the color of each object is
    their attribute.
    Our method provides control over the color of each object independently,
    whereas both HyperNeRF{+}$\pi$ and Ours{-}$\MaskNet$ fail to deliver
    controllability and results in all three objects having the same attribute
    in the rendered scene.
