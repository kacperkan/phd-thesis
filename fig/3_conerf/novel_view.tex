  \caption{{\bf Novel view and novel attribute synthesis on real data --}
    We synthesize scenes from a novel view and with a novel attribute
    combination, not seen during training.
    % \ky{
    A naive extension of HyperNeRF, HyperNeRF{+}$\pi$ fails to disentangle
    attributes and results in a modification of the scene irrespectively of
    attribute meaning \eg, opening mouth results in closing eyes at the same
    time.
    % is not what the attributes are describing--- and vice versa. 
    Ours-$\MaskNet$ improves the results, but does not disentangles the
    attribute space, as successfully done by our complete method.
    % results in entanglement.
    The differences between these methods can even lead to complete failure
    cases, as shown in the metronome and the toy car case.

  % \cite{park2021hypernerf} with a projection network $\mathcal{A}$ to predict
  % attribute values $\{\attribute_\iAttribute\}$ causes that changes in the
  % output become entangled, \eg, opening the mouth also closes the
