    Our model may learn spurious interpolations for controlled elements that
    occupy little space in the image and with insufficient/careless
    annotations.
    % the number of annotations is not sufficient.
    For the metronome, due to the fast motion of the pendulum and its
    specularity, without careful annotation our method may simply learn its
    motion blur or sometimes even completely ignore the pendulum.
    In the face example, this may result in the eye blinking multiple times
    while interpolating between the attribute values of $-1$ and $1$.
    Both cases are preventable with more careful annotations and by annotating
    more frames.
    % interpolating between $-1$ and $1$ of all attributes causes opening eyes
    % for several values.
